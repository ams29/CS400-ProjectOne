Bob is a young builder but his dream was to become a billionaire. He used to work 12 hrs a day
so he he could feed his wife and daughter. However, one day, he fell off a ladder and injured his
shoulder. Bob injured his shoulder so badly that he was told he can never do anything physically
hard again. He was broken. One day when he was in his house, he came across an advertisement 
to learn how to code. 

The advertisement said the coding would help him make more money than becoming a builder. He tried to take the course and learned multiple programming languages. He achieved several successful projects. After some time, he did feed his wife and children well. But he suddenly found the programming had less fun than his old construction works. And it did make lots of money but still had some distance to become a billionaire.
